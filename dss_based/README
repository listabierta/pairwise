Abstract
--------
This is a ruby client for DSS based webservices.

It allows signature verification/update using DSS's VerifyRequest and timestamp generation using SignRequest.

This client implements only a subset of all the features defined on DSS 1.0 . It has been test with Tractis Webservices but should be compatible with other servers implementing DSS.

Installation
------------
We offer a Rakefile generating a gem. You can use the client inside a gem or in any other flavour that you may want.

To generate the gem just go to  webservices-clients/ruby/dss_based and type : 
	
	rake gem

This will generate the gem file. To install the gem from the same dir just type:
	
	sudo gem install dss_client-0.0.1.gem

Once installed check it's available on system gems typing :

	gem list 

It must include a line showing dss_client (0.0.1).

Usage
-----
With the gem installed just require it to start using it. 

require 'rubygems'
require 'dss_client'

@connector = DssClient.new

Signature validation
---------------------

	#Now to validate a signature (detached) over a document just perform

	result = @connector.validate_signature(signature, document, {})

	#Result will include the validation result.

Signature validation and completition
-------------------------------------

	#To validate and update a signature to a form (f.ex XAdES X-L)

	result = @connector.validate_signature(signature, document, {:form => 'urn:oasis:names:tc:dss:1.0:profiles:AdES:forms:ES-X-L'})

	#Result will include the validation result as well as the updated signature.


Timestamp generation
--------------------
	document = "Hello this is a content but you can provide content from any source"
	result = @connector.stamp_content(document)
	timestamp = result.signature_object
